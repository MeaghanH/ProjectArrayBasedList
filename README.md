# ProjectArrayBasedList

Project Description 

You are given an interface for a type of list. The list works like this:

entries can only be added to and removed from the front or back of the list
entries can be accessed in any position
the size of the list is limited ("capped"); when the size is reached, no more entries can be added
entries begin at index 0
Write a class that implements this interface. The class uses arrays to implement the list.
